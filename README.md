# Description

A landing page for a quirky bookstore.

The user can scroll through the page to find events, about information and contact information. The page is built with Bootstrap, so it contains many Bootstrap components, such as a navbar, tab-lists, thumbnails, collapsible images, and forms.

There's also a simple search form and contact form, however these are only for concept since the application is front-end only.
